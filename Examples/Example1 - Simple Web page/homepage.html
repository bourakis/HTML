    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
    William Henry Gates III (born October 28, 1955) is an American business
    magnate, investor, author, philanthropist, humanitarian, and principal
    founder of Microsoft Corporation.[2][3] During his career at Microsoft,
    Gates held the positions of chairman, CEO and chief software architect,
    while also being the largest individual shareholder until May 2014.

    <h2>Early Life</h2>

    <p>
    Gates was born in Seattle, Washington, on October 28, 1955. He is the son
    of William H. Gates Sr.[b] (b. 1925) and Mary Maxwell Gates (1929–1994).
    His ancestry includes English, German, Irish, and Scots-Irish.[18][19] His
    father was a prominent lawyer, and his mother served on the board of
    directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way. Gates'
    maternal grandfather was J.W, Maxwell, a national bank president. Gates
    has one older sister, Kristi (Kristianne), and a younger sister, Libby.
    He is the fourth of his name in his family, but is known as William
    Gates III or "Trey" because his father had the "II" suffix.[20] Early
    on in his life, Gates observed that his parents wanted him to pursue a
    law career.[21] When Gates was young, his family regularly attended a
    church of the Congregational Christian Churches, a Protestant Reformed
    denomination. The family encouraged competition; one visitor
    reported that "it didn't matter whether it was hearts or pickleball or
    swimming to the dock ... there was always a reward for winning and there
    was always a penalty for losing".

    At 13, he enrolled in the Lakeside School, a private preparatory school.
    When Gates was in the eighth grade, the Mothers' Club at the school used
    proceeds from Lakeside School's rummage sale to buy a Teletype Model 33
    ASR terminal and a block of computer time on a General Electric (GE)
    computer for the school's students.[27] Gates took an interest in
    programming the GE system in BASIC, and was excused from math classes
    to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this
    machine: an implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play
    games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how
    it would always execute software code perfectly. When he reflected back
    on that moment, he said, "There was just something neat about the machine.
    "[28] After the Mothers Club donation was exhausted, he and other students
    sought time on systems including DEC PDP minicomputers. One of these
    systems was a PDP-10 belonging to Computer Center Corporation (CCC),
    which banned four Lakeside students – Gates, Paul Allen, Ric Weiland,
    and Kent Evans – for the summer after it caught them exploiting bugs in
    the operating system to obtain free computer time.[29][30]
