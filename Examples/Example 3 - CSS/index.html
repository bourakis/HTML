  Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee OM KBE FRS FREng FRSA FBCS (born 8 June 1955),
  also known as TimBL, is an English engineer and computer scientist, best known
  as the inventor of the World Wide Web. He is currently a professor of Computer
  Science at the University of Oxford and at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
  (MIT). He made a proposal for an information management system in March 1989,
  and he implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext
  Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the internet in mid-November
  the same year.

  Berners-Lee is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which
  oversees the continued development of the Web. He is also the founder of the
  World Wide Web Foundation and is a senior researcher and holder of the 3Com
  founders chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
  Laboratory (CSAIL). He is a director of the Web Science Research
  Initiative (WSRI), and a member of the advisory board of the MIT
  Center for Collective Intelligence. In 2011, he was named as a
  member of the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation. He is a

  After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications
  company Plessey in Poole, Dorset.[24] In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in
  Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create type-setting software for printers.

<p class="p-style1">
  Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December
  1980. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext,
  to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers.
  To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE.
</p>

<p class="p-style1">
  After leaving CERN in late 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image
  Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, Dorset.He ran the company's
  technical side for three years.The project he worked on was a
  "real-time remote procedure call" which gave him experience in computer
  networking.[29] In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow.

<p class="p-style1">
  In 1989, CERN was the largest internet node in Europe, and Berners-Lee saw
  an opportunity to join hypertext with the internet.
